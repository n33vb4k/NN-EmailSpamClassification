# NN-EmailSpamClassification

training set consists of 1000 rows and 55 columns. Each row corresponds to one email message. The first column is the response variable and describes whether a message is spam 1 or ham 0. The remaining 54 columns are features that you will use to build a classifier. These features correspond to 54 different keywords (such as "money", "free", and "receive") and special characters (such as ":", "!", and "$"). A feature has the value 1 if the keyword appears in the message and 0 otherwise.
